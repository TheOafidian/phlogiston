# Phlogiston

A python package that allows visualization (in 2 or 3D) of fictional starcharts. 
Written to be used for a D&D Spelljammer campaign.

# Installation

Installation can currently be done from the repo itself.
```
git clone https://github.com/TheOafidian/phlogiston.git
cd phlogiston
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

# Usage

Phlogiston has two modes: 
- chart: reads coordinate data and plots them in a plotly graph.
- random: generates a random starchart and saves the coordinates to a file (can be modified and used as input for chart).
